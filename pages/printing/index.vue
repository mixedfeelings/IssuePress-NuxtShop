                    <p>While Issue Press is primarily a publishing project, that practice is partially financed through the offer of Risograph printing of exceptional quality.</p>
                    <p>Issue Press is run by one person in the margins of a completely unrelated day job (hi!), so what I may lack in speed I hope to make up for in above-average attention to detail and focus on craft.</p>
                    <p>I am not able to accomodate projects on rushed timelines, but luckily there are no many, many Risograph printers operating around the world at various capacities and I recommend checking out <a href="https://stencil.wiki/atlas" target="_blank">The Atlas of Modern Risography</a>, a resource built and maintained by me to help connect people to the burgeoning worldwide Risograph community.</p>
                    <p>If you are further interested in Risograph printing with Issue Press, please peruse the information and guidelines in this section and <NuxtLink to="/printing/request-quote">request a quote</NuxtLink>.</p>
